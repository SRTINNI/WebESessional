CLO-2: Design different web pages by using modern tools.

D. Creating Interactive Web Forms
    •Objective: Design and style web forms, including form validation and user feedback.
    •Description: Students will design a fully functional web form using HTML and CSS, incorporating various input types (text, email, date, etc.). They will also add styling for a user-friendly interface and implement basic client-side validation using JavaScript.
    
    Client-Side(Front-end) Responsibilities:
        ->Displaying the form to the user.
        ->Validating form inputs before submission.
        ->Providing immediate feedback and interaction without requiring a server response.
    Server-Side(Back-end) Responsibilities:
        ->Receiving and processing the form data sent from the client.
        ->Storing data in databases or performing other operations.
        ->Sending responses back to the client, such as confirmation messages or errors.

    Deliverables:
        •	Submit the index.html, styles.css, and script.js files.
        •	Provide a report documenting the form design, validation process, and the outcomes.
    Learning Outcome:
    By the end of this experiment, you should be able to design and style interactive web forms, implement client-side(front-end) validation using JavaScript, and provide user feedback to ensure a smooth user experience.


Example Workflow:

Client: User submits the form.
Server: PHP script processes the data and stores it in a database.
Client: User sees a confirmation message or feedback.
